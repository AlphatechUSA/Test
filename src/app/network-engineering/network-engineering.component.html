              Alpha Technologies USA Inc. strongly believes that extensive planning should go into a network installation/implementation
              for quality purposes. A good project plan will help identify any strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, or threats.
              The plan should clearly define the tasks, & the order in which tasks are completed. Our main goal during
              the structured systems analysis is to accurately represent user & client needs. To make the project manageable,
              it will be divided it into modules that can be more easily maintained & changed.
            </h3>
            <h3>
              A network that is a patchwork of devices strung together, using a mixture of technologies & protocols, is usually an indicator
              of poor initial planning. These types of networks are susceptible to downtime, & are difficult to maintain
              & troubleshoot. Therefore, at the planning stage, our network engineer needs to take account of the existing
              equipment & technologies the network would have to operate with & their compatibility with the proposed
              equipment.

                  All the necessary information needed is gathered during a site survey & also from the client end users. A site survey provides
                  much information to the network engineer/designer & creates a proper starting point for the project.
                  It shows what is already on site, & gives a good indication as to what is needed.

                  Devices & cabling must be selected based on the requirements outlined in the Analysis Report. Multiple designs may also
                  be created to view the LAN from a documentation perspective & evaluate trade-offs in performance and
                  cost. It is during this step that any weaknesses of the design can be identified & addressed.

                  During this phase, all configuration to network devices & physical connections are started, if there are tasks that have
                  been overlooked in the earlier phases, they must be corrected during implementation. Creation of a good
                  implementation schedule & allowing for some additional time for unexpected events keep disruption of
                  the clientâ€™s business to a minimum. During the implementation, there should be strict adherence to standards,
                  such as color codes, operational limits, etc. Staying in constant communication with the client during
                  the installation is always critical to the success of the project.

                  The network is brought into service in what is termed a production environment. Prior to this step, the network is considered
                  to be in a testing or implementation phase. Operations objective is to achieve the lowest latency & highest
                  frequency possible to ensure business continuity.

                  After the network is operational, the design & implementation will need to be reviewed & evaluated. For this process,
                  the following steps are recommended: Compare the user experience with the goals in the documentation and
                  evaluate if the design is right for the job. Compare the projected designs & costs with the actual deployment.
                  This ensures that future projects will benefit from the lessons learned on this project. Monitor the operation
                  & record changes. This ensures that the system is always fully documented & accountable.
